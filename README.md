# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** 800
**Overlap:** 0 

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->


My 14 documents are Markdown guides divided into `##` sections. I measured all 98 sections across the corpus: median 284 characters, longest 711, and not one of them exceeds 800.

The starter chunker doesn't see those sections. It counts 800 characters from the start of the whole document and cuts there, which lands in the middle of a section. 35 of its 51 chunks (68%) begin mid-word. The shortest, `guide_eating.md#3`, is 24 characters: `"d Sundays and after 5pm."` — the tail of "Elder Ness has one shop, closed Sundays and after 5pm.", with the town name and the word "closed" cut away.

So I split on `##` section boundaries instead. Because the longest section is 711, CHUNK_SIZE = 800 becomes a safety cap that never fires on this corpus. I set overlap to 0 because overlap exists to rescue sentences cut at arbitrary positions, and splitting on section boundaries never cuts a sentence.

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

Chunk 1  |  source: admin_add_drop_deadline.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents | function: def split_documents
======================================================================
On the add/drop deadline

You can add a course through the end of the second week. Dropping is a longer window — through the end of week six — but a drop after week two shows as a W on your transcript. Nothing anywhere on the registrar's site says this plainly, and students find out from each other.

======================================================================
Chunk 2  |  source: course_biol_160.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents | function: def split_documents
======================================================================
BIOL 160 Cell Biology

I lived here my sophomore year. Format is lecture three times a week with a weekly lab. Assessment: four unit tests and a cumulative final. Not curved.

Expect 9 to 11 hours a week, the heaviest first-year course by reputation.

The one piece of advice: the unit tests come fast, roughly every three weeks; falling behind once is very hard to recover from.

======================================================================
Chunk 3  |  source: course_hist_118_workload.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents | function: def split_documents
======================================================================
Workload for HIST 118 Modern World History

People keep asking so: a lot of reading, about 120 pages a week, but no problem sets. That's real time, not optimistic time.

It's front-loaded — the first month is heavier than the rest, partly because you're learning the format.

======================================================================
Chunk 4  |  source: dining_pellew_dining_hall_followup.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents | function: def split_documents
======================================================================
Re: Pellew Dining Hall

Adding to what people have said about Pellew Dining Hall. The wait figure of 12 to 18 minutes at peak matches what I've seen. If you're trying to eat between classes, go before 11:45 and it's a different building entirely.

Also worth saying: the furthest hall from anywhere, next to the athletics centre. Nobody tells you this at orientation.

======================================================================
Chunk 5  |  source: housing_innisfree_hall.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents | function: def split_documents
======================================================================
Innisfree Hall — what it's actually like

Transferred in last year, so take this with a grain of salt. Built 1991, renovated 2022. Rooms are doubles arranged as pairs sharing one bathroom between two rooms.

The good: the shared-bathroom-between-two-rooms arrangement is the best compromise on campus.

The bad: no air conditioning, which matters for the first three weeks of September.

Laundry costs $1.75 wash, $1.75 dry, app-based. On noise: moderate; the building is L-shaped and the short wing is much quieter.

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:** Which course is the heaviest first-year course by reputation and how many exams does it have per semester?

**Answer:**

Based on course_biol_160_workload.txt and course_biol_160.txt, BIOL 160
Cell Biology is the heaviest first-year course by reputation. According to
course_biol_160.txt, it has four unit tests and a cumulative final per
semester.

Sources retrieved: admin_graduation_requirements.txt, admin_pass_fail_option.txt,
course_biol_160.txt, course_biol_160_workload.txt, course_cs_340.txt

Produced by `app.py::ask_pipeline`, which calls `generate.py::answer_from_chunks`.
Best distance 0.4844, under the 0.55 cutoff.

``
```

**My relevance cutoff:**

**My relevance cutoff:** 0.55

I ran all ten questions through `app.py retrieve`, which reports distances
without spending a model call, and recorded the best distance for each.

The two groups don't overlap and they don't even come close. The worst
in-corpus question landed at 0.4844; the closest out-of-scope question at
0.8232. That leaves 0.3388 of empty space with nothing in it.

I moved the cutoff down from the starter's 0.6 rather than up. Both directions
pass all ten, so the ten numbers alone don't decide it — what decides it is
which failure I'd rather have. A confident wrong answer is harder to notice
than a refusal, so I'd rather the system refuse a question it could have
answered than answer one it couldn't.

I first tried 0.5 and backed off. It clears 0.4844 by only 0.0156, and I know
that number moves: adding a single `?` to my ECON 101 question shifted its
distance from 0.3504 to 0.3438. One punctuation mark is worth 0.0066, so 0.5
gives me about two punctuation marks of room. 0.4844 is the worst distance
among the five questions I happened to write, not the worst a real question
could produce. 0.55 keeps 0.0656 — roughly ten times the punctuation effect —
and still refuses all five out-of-scope questions by a margin of 0.27.

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
| What is the expected workload for ECON101? | Yes | 0.3438 |
| What type of clothing is recommended during winter, and by what time are the paths cleared on weekdays? | Yes | 0.3617 |
| For students need whiteboards, which study rooms should they go? | Yes | 0.3656 |
| In Aldridge hall, which floors are quiet floors and how many washers and dryers does it have? | Yes | 0.4139 |
| Which course is the heaviest first-year course by reputation and how many exams does it have per semester? | Yes | 0.4844 |
| What is the capital of Mongolia? | No | 0.8232 |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | No | 0.8442 |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup? | No | 0.8859 |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust? | No | 0.8960 |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine? | No | 0.9340 |

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
